# Folder by Feature CLI Utility :open_file_folder:

A Dart CLI tool that generates the folder structure for the folder-by-feature pattern. This tool helps to reduce the repetitive work required to setup directories for models, services, repositories, screens and widgets.

The folder structure generated by the cli is as follows:

```md
feature/
┣ domain/
┃ ┣ models/
┃ ┣ repository/
┃ ┣ services/
┃ ┗ index.dart
┣ screens/
┃ ┣ feature_screen.dart
┃ ┗ index.dart
┣ widgets/
┃ ┣ feature_component.dart
┃ ┗ index.dart
┣ providers/
┃ ┣ feature_provider.dart
┃ ┗ index.dart
┗ index.dart
```

## Command Usage :wrench:
